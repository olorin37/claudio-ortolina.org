The Race for Space</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-1 class=outline-text-2><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VlnwuV6RuMo style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div></p><p>The album opens with rearranged fragments of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_choose_to_go_to_the_Moon>US President John F. Kennedy's speech</a> given at Rice University, Houston, Texas, on September 12, 1962. The speech sets the tone of the entire album, celebrating mankind's efforts to reach beyond the stars:</p><blockquote><p>Many years ago, Great British explorer George Mallory<br>Who was to die on Mount Everest<br>Was asked 'why did he want to climb it?'<br>He said 'because it is there'<br>Well space is there and we're going to climb it<br>And the moon and the planets are there<br>And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there<br>And therefore as we set sail we ask God's blessing<br>On the most hazardous, and dangerous, and greatest adventure<br>On which man has ever embarked – John F. Kennedy</p></blockquote><p>It's difficult to listen to this speech without anticipation, especially knowing <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11>what would happen 7 years later</a>.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-2 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-2>2. Sputnik</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-2><p>The second track, <em>Sputnik</em>, takes us to the Soviet Union in 1957, to tell the story of the first object ever sent into space, the low Earth orbit satellite <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1>Sputnik 1</a>.</p><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/It42TsD7_sI style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div></p><p>In <em>Sputnik</em>, the original sounds of the unmanned spacecraft gradually become part of the main beat and gradually build excitement for the beginning of "man's cosmic existence".</p><blockquote><p>The man made celestial body, for the first time in history<br>Overcame terrestrial gravity and flew into space<br>All men of all nations recognise this as a great achievement<br>In an age where the race to conquer space has become an all-absorbing factor</p><p>The era of man's cosmic existence</p></blockquote><p>Once again, the accent is on how people can be united by such an important event:</p><blockquote><p>All over the world, people are tuning in to the 'bleep bleep bleep' of the satellite</p><p>A dream cherished by men for many centuries comes true on October the 4th, 1957</p></blockquote></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-3>3. Gagarin</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-2><p>If <em>Sputnik</em> makes you tap your feet, then <em>Gagarin</em> will make you dance: to tell the story of the first ever cosmonaut, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin>Yuri Gagarin</a>, PBS wrote an explosive song, a mix of funk, brass, marching band, you-name-it tune that captures the euphoria of such an important moment.</p><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wY-kAnvOY80 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div></p><p>The jump into the unknown is not something to be scared of:</p><blockquote><p>The World's first cosmonaut<br>The first to open the door into the unknown<br>The first to step over the threshold of our homeland</p></blockquote><p>Gagarin himself appreciated his new vantage point:</p><blockquote><p>Astronaut to Earth: I can see forests, rivers, [?] all around<br>Everything's so beautiful, it's wonderful, it wonderful…</p></blockquote></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-4 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-4>4. Fire in the Cockpit</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-2><p>After <em>Gagarin</em>, <em>Fire in the Cockpit</em> is a cold shower and a stark reminder of the risks and cost of exploration, telling the tragedy of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1>Apollo 1</a>, where three astronauts lost their lives due to a cabin fire during a test.</p><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QLA9-1U7Vrw style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div></p><p>The entire song revolves around the sound of static and deep keyboard tones, with a cello entering midway as we listen to the words of NASA's description of the events. It's a sad song, but exhibits the composure and respect owed to people who lost their lives while trying to advance the frontiers of human knowledge.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-5 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-5>5. E.V.A.</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-5 class=outline-text-2><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/PFSq4Q8WDs0 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div></p><p>In <em>E.V.A.</em><sup class=footnote-reference><a id=footnote-reference-1 href=#footnote-1>1</a></sup> we hear the story of Alexei Leonov, Alexei Leonov completed the first spacewalk in 1965, spending 10 minutes outside in open space.</p><p>It's interesting how the music almost stops when the astronaut leaves the spacecraft, mimicking the silence of the vacuum of space. The few piano notes we can hear really complement the marvel of Leonov's words:</p><blockquote><p>I'm on the edge of the opening<br>Of the airlock chamber<br>I feel excellent<br>I see clouds and the sea<br>I am beginning to move away</p></blockquote></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-6 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-6>6. The Other Side</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-6 class=outline-text-2><p><em>The Other Side</em> takes us one step closer to the moon landing, focusing on the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8>Apollo 8</a> mission, where for the first time a manned spacecraft completed an orbit of the moon, but from the unusual point of view of ground control.</p><p>We hear voices and recordings from the control room, where ground control monitors the spacecraft as it's about to reach the blind side of the moon. The excitement and anxiety are palpable: to complete a lunar orbit, Apollo will temporarily lose signal with earth.</p><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/P8LlUrT7MFo style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div></p><p>Once again, the music tells the story without words, getting quiet during loss of signal and exploding into a liberating instrumental when Apollo finally replies back to Houston. The event is incredibly significant:</p><blockquote><p>The unmanned lunar spacecraft traversed the moon perhaps over 10, 000 times<br>But this is the first that a man aboard reported to his compatriots here on Earth</p></blockquote></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-7 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-7>7. Valentina</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-7 class=outline-text-2><p><em>Valentina</em> is a celebration of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentina_Tereshkova>Valentina Tereshkova</a>, the first woman to ever go to space n 1963 (and to this date, the only one having ever been in a solo mission).</p><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bnmq4WR83Mw style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div></p><p>The song, which features choruses from <a href=http://www.smokefairies.com/>The Smoke Fairies</a>, is a graceful instrumental without any other vocals. J. Willgoose, Esq. writes on the matter:</p><blockquote><p>One of the biggest problems with the material we use, from the period we address, is that it almost totally devoid of any female voice.<br>It is often said that history is written by the winners, but it would be equally if not more apt to say that it has overwhelmingly been written by men. Of the footage I obtained of the first woman in space, all of it featured her voice being translated by male voices.<br>Rather than yet more men - us, in this case - attempting to speak on her behalf, it seemed more appropriate to ask a guest singer to provide a female voice, so we tried a different approach with 'Valentina' and I'm very glad we did.</p></blockquote></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-8 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-8>8. Go!</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-8 class=outline-text-2><p>The story of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11>Apollo 11</a> and the first crew to land on the moon in 1969 represents one of the most important moments of human history. Once again, PBS decides to focus on the point of view of the people on the ground, to celebrate the often unseen work of preparation, monitoring, incredible engineering that made the whole thing possible.</p><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BHIo6qwJarI style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div></p><p><em>Go!</em> is giant checklist, where we hear the flight director Gene Kranz go through all the checks needed to make sure that the descent on the moon will be successful. It's so interesting that the landing itself is just a couple of verses in the middle:</p><blockquote><p>Houston, uh<br>Tranquility base here, The Eagle has landed</p></blockquote><p>The repetition in the dialogues provides the rhythm of the song, which matches the excitement of the mission with upbeat percussions, synth and keyboard.</p><p><em>Go!</em> is a reminder that we can achieve the impossible if we work together.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-9 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-9>9.
