Since I was a toddler, my parents (and particularly my dad) got me used to listen to 80s rock music. Bands like Queen, Guns N' Roses, AC/DC, Van Halen, and Bon Jovi are ingrained in my memories as sounds of my childhood.</p><p>It's not surprising that my taste in music has developed from there, branching out over the years in metal and progressive rock. Music is a constant companion of my daily life and contributed to the formation of my identity.</p><p>My taste changed and adapted: around ten years ago I was dismissing <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation:_Mindcrime><em>Operation: Mindcrime</em></a> by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensrÿche>Queensrÿche</a> as a mediocre album, but two years ago I picked it up again and it was a revelation. Something similar happened while listening to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_Against_the_Machine>Rage Against the Machine</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool>Tool</a> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Perfect_Circle>A Perfect Circle</a>, didn't like them years ago, absolutely love them now.</p><p>This change got me thinking - why do these bands resonate with me now?</p><p>I think the answer lies primarily in the integrity of the message connected to these bands: their perspective, political stance, perspective on life really struck a cord with me in my 30s. They take an explicit position around issues I care about.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-2 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-2>Enter Marillion and Fish</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-3><p><img src=/img/fish/fish-photo.jpg alt="Fish's portrait" class=left style=float:left;margin-right:1rem></p><p>Until a year ago, I had a very cursory knowledge of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marillion>Marillion</a>'s body of work. I kney they existed, that they have a substantial discography and that they represent an important page in the history of 80s and 90s prog.</p><p>One morning, Spotify's suggestions algorithm decided to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lalBmbrWEvQ"><em>Incommunicado</em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6COmtBk6lYo"><em>Sugar Mice</em></a> in the space of an hour. I found myself stopping what I was doing in both instances - there was something about those songs that really dragged my attention. I loved the music - but the lyrics stopped me in my tracks.</p><p><em>Incommunicado</em> is about ambition, the drive to make it big without taking responsibilities. In the context of the entire album, it's both a metaphor for the difficult life of Torch, the main character whose life is falling to pieces, but also a direct description of the music business.</p><p><em>Sugar Mice</em> is a song about the devastating effects of unemployment and economic recession. The title refers to a popular english sweet made of sugar. The main refrain "We're just sugar mice in the rain" gives a very vivid representation of how fragile life can be.</p><p>The words, references, and metaphors included in the lyrics stood out as something completely out of the ordinary - it <span style=text-decoration:underline>sounded</span> like poetry.</p><p>The more I explored other Marillion's songs, the more I realized that what really resonated with me was <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_(singer)>Fish</a>, their initial singer and lyricist. Following his body of work after he left Marillion, I kept finding incredible songs.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-3>Love and relationships</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-3><blockquote><p>Do you remember?<br>Barefoot on the lawn with shooting stars<br>Do you remember?<br>The loving on the floor in Belsize Park<br>Do you remember?<br>Dancing in stilettoes in the snow<br>Do you remember?<br>You never understood I had to go<br>By the way, didn't I break your heart?<br>Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart<br>So sorry, I never meant to break your heart<br>But you broke mine — <em>Kayleigh, 1985</em></p></blockquote><p>By far the most succesful Marillion song, <em>Kayleigh</em> is often cited as Fish's apology to different women for the failure of their romantic relationships, a collage of vivid images and melancholic moments.</p><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4oaLUilBc style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div></p><p>To me, this song sows the seeds of a theme that goes through a few songs written by Fish: work/life balance. Relationships fail when you divert your attention away from them, when you don't put in everyday work to keep them going.</p><p>In <em>Zoë 25</em> it's the aftermath of another relationship that didn't go well:</p><blockquote><p>When you're looking for somebody, you might not even see them,<br>When they're standing there in front of you, right before your eyes,<br>If you're looking for somebody you're gonna need some help,<br>You know you'll never find her when you're looking for yourself. — <em>Zoë 25, 2007</em></p></blockquote><p>In <em>Garden of Remembrance</em>, it's Alzheimer's disease, something completely outside our control:</p><blockquote><p>He's lost between the here and now<br>Somewhere that he can't be found<br>She's still here<br>Her love a ghost of memory<br>She'll wait for an eternity<br>He's still here — <em>Garden of Remembrance, 2020</em></p></blockquote><p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-RwwU8Nvs1g style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div></p><p>In <em>cliche</em>, the song lyrics use estabilished cliches to acknowledge that no matter how much hard you try, sometimes the simplest thing you can say is what matters.</p><blockquote><p>That's why I'm trying to say with my deepest sincerity<br>That's why I'm finding it comes down to the basic simplicities<br>The best way is with an old cliche<br>It's simply the best way is with an old cliche<br>Always the best way is with an old cliche<br>I'll leave it to the best way, it's an old cliche<br>I love you. — <em>Cliche, 1990</em></p></blockquote><p>In <em>Punch and Judy</em><sup class=footnote-reference><a id=footnote-reference-1 href=#footnote-1>1</a></sup> it's the progressive deterioration of a relationship, escalating in murdering fantasies:</p><blockquote><p>Whatever happened to morning smiles,<br>Whatever happened to wicked wiles, permissive styles,<br>Whatever happened to twinkling eyes,<br>Whatever happened to hard fast drives,<br>Complements on unnatural size</p><p>Punch, Punch, Punch And Judy, Punch, Punch, Punch And Judy<br>Punch, Punch, Punch And Judy.</p><p>Propping up a bar, family car,<br>Sweating out a mortgage as a balding clerk,<br>Punch And Judy, [Judy]<br>World war three, suburbanshee,<br>Just slip her these pills and I'll be free.</p><p>No more Judy, Judy. Judy no more! Goodbye Judy! — <em>Punch and Judy, 1984</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-4 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-4>Living on your own terms</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-3><p>Another recurring topic is the idea of living on your own terms. From <em>Tongues</em>, where Fish lets out the frustration of dealing with lawyers during a very long lawsuit with music publisher EMI:</p><blockquote><p>Your entrenched opinions,<br>On the border of arrogance,<br>Dug in against the compromise.<br>A position indefensible, your actions illogical<br>You're speaking in tongues</p><p>You swear contradictions<br>Your tedious monologues, wielding authority,<br>Demanding subservience, demanding<br>I make your sense.<br>Demanding speaking in tongues. — <em>Tongues, 1991</em></p></blockquote><p>The inability to speak the same language becomes a massive blocker. The aforementioned lawsuit with EMI ended up being a fundamental event in Fish's life, pushing him to pursue the ownership of all rights of his solo albums (except the first one, <em>Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors</em>).</p><p>In <em>Circle Line</em><sup class=footnote-reference><a id=footnote-reference-2 href=#footnote-2>2</a></sup>, it's the awareness of the 9-to-5 grind that is imposed on the majority of us:</p><blockquote><p>9 to 5's the only time I try to kid myself that I'm still alive,<br>That I'm living out the dream to earn my freedom from this rat race<br>Where all I do's survive, I live the lie, I serve my time.</p><p>The circle line.</p><p>Just another day, just another day, just another day,<br>Just another day, just another day, just another day on the circle line.</p><p>The circle line, on the circle line. — <em>Circle Line, 2007</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Lost Plot</em>, on losing track of what matters:</p><blockquote><p>I was blinded by light but the vision had died, I'd forgotten<br>In time just what I was fighting for<br>I'd forgotten who's side I was on, the difference between<br>Right and wrong<br>I was out of my depth, going out of my mind, going down in<br>A field where no prisoners are taken, no quarter is given<br>The writing was small, it burned on the wall, I'd sold out<br>My soul for what it was worth<br>I'd lost the plot, my number was up, the game was over<br>Snakes and ladders, a world of snakes and ladders, snakes<br>And ladders — <em>Lost Plot, 2004</em></p></blockquote><p><em>View from the Hill</em>, where we the hill is an endless collection of things that don't matter and just keep us imprisoned.</p><p><figure class=center><img src=/img/fish/the-hill.jpg alt="Illustration of the Hill, one of the main metaphors in the album Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors"><figcaption class=center>Artwork for the album of Vigil in the Wilderness of Mirrors, by Mark Wilkinson</figcaption></figure></p><blockquote><p>You sit and think that everything is coming up roses<br>But you can't see the weeds that entangle your feet<br>You can't see the wood for the trees 'cause the forest is burning<br>And you say it's the smoke in your eyes that's making you cry</p><p>They sold you the view from a hill<br>They told you that the view from the hill would be<br>Further than you have ever seen before<br>They sold you a view from a hill<br>They sold you a view from a hill — <em>View from the Hill, 1990</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-5 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-5>The system has failed (us)</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-5 class=outline-text-3><p>Fish has never shied away from commenting on politics: from <em>Market Square Heroes</em> (Marillion's first single) to <em>Weltschmerz</em>, the ending track of his latest (and last) album.</p><p><em>Market Square Heroes</em><sup class=footnote-reference><a id=footnote-reference-3 href=#footnote-3>3</a></sup> is once again an anthem of an angry generation that suffers the consequences of austerity and recession:</p><blockquote><p>I give peace signs when I wage war in the disco<br>I'm the warrior in the ultra violet haze<br>Armed with antisocial insecurity<br>I plan the path of destiny from this maze</p><p>Cause I'm a Market Square hero gathering the storms to troop<br>Cause I'm a Market Square hero speeding the beat of the street pulse<br>Are you following me, are you following me?<br>Well suffer my fallen angels and follow me<br>I'm the Market Square hero, I'm the Market Square hero<br>We are Market Square Heroes, to be Market Square Heroes — <em>Market Square Heroes, 1982</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Weltschmerz</em> is a summary of all fights worth fighting - from climate change, to poverty, to the general failure of a political system that emphasized polarisation and division:</p><blockquote><p>I am a grey bearded warrior, a poet of no mean acclaim<br>My words are my weapons that I proffer with disdain<br>My melancholy aspect is something you can’t disregard<br>My motives you cannot question nor my strong sense of right and wrong\\</p><p>I’ve formed the opinion that things can’t stay as they are<br>My anger and my fury trapped like a wasp in a jar<br>It’s never too late to make a brave new start<br>When the revolution is called I will play my part — <em>Weltschmerz, 2020</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-6 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-6>Perfume River</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-6 class=outline-text-3><p><em>Perfume River</em><sup class=footnote-reference><a id=footnote-reference-4 href=#footnote-4>4</a></sup> deserves a mention on its own: in this song, Fish looks at the consequences of the Vietnam War, whose images are burned in his childhood memory.</p><p><figure class=center><img src=/img/fish/feast-of-consequences.jpg alt="Artwork for the album Feast of Consequences"><figcaption class=center>Artwork for the album Feast of Consequences by Mark Wilkinson</figcaption></figure></p><blockquote><p>Fire breathing dragons swarm in sweltering skies, spewing flame on innocents below<br>Charred and brittle corpses, blackened evidence, I am enraged, I am afraid, I am forlorn<br>The ashes from wise pages fly from libraries, tumble in the clouds of smoke and flies<br>To lie as dust in corners of dark palaces, the fetid smell of revolution haunts the air.</p><p>Take me away to the Perfume River; carry me down to the perfume river<br>Set me adrift on a well-stocked open boat<br>Show me the way to the Perfume River, send me away down the perfume river<br>Pour that sweet, sweet liquor down my throat; pour it down my throat — <em>Perfume River, 2013</em></p></blockquote><p>Once again, the images evoked are incredibly strong, full of colour - red flames and rage, smoke, dust and death.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-7 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-7>Visuals</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-7 class=outline-text-3><p>A powerful ingredient in Fish's artistic work has always been his collaboration with <a href=https://www.the-masque.com/mainpage.html>Mark Wilkinson</a>, who illustrated all Marillion's albums (until Fish left the band) and all of Fish's work.
