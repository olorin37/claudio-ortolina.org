Prelude
&lt;/h3>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-3">
&lt;p>
I have very early memories of rock music in my life. Since I was a toddler, my parents (and particularly my dad) got me used to listen to 80s rock music. Bands like Queen, Guns N&amp;#39; Roses, AC/DC, Van Halen, and Bon Jovi are ingrained in my memories as sounds of my childhood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
It&amp;#39;s not surprising that my taste in music has developed from there, branching out over the years in metal and progressive rock. Music is a constant companion of my daily life and contributed to the formation of my identity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
My taste changed and adapted: around ten years ago I was dismissing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation:_Mindcrime">&lt;em>Operation: Mindcrime&lt;/em>&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensrÿche">Queensrÿche&lt;/a> as a mediocre album, but two years ago I picked it up again and it was a revelation. Something similar happened while listening to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_Against_the_Machine">Rage Against the Machine&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool">Tool&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Perfect_Circle">A Perfect Circle&lt;/a>, didn&amp;#39;t like them years ago, absolutely love them now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
This change got me thinking - why do these bands resonate with me now?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
I think the answer lies primarily in the integrity of the message connected to these bands: their perspective, political stance, perspective on life really struck a cord with me in my 30s. They take an explicit position around issues I care about.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="outline-container-headline-2" class="outline-3">
&lt;h3 id="headline-2">
Enter Marillion and Fish
&lt;/h3>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
&lt;p>
&lt;img src="http://claudio-ortolina.org/img/fish/fish-photo.jpg" alt="Fish&amp;#39;s portrait" class="left" style="float: left; margin-right: 1rem;" />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Until a year ago, I had a very cursory knowledge of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marillion">Marillion&lt;/a>&amp;#39;s body of work. I kney they existed, that they have a substantial discography and that they represent an important page in the history of 80s and 90s prog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
One morning, Spotify&amp;#39;s suggestions algorithm decided to play &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lalBmbrWEvQ">&lt;em>Incommunicado&lt;/em>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6COmtBk6lYo">&lt;em>Sugar Mice&lt;/em>&lt;/a> in the space of an hour. I found myself stopping what I was doing in both instances - there was something about those songs that really dragged my attention. I loved the music - but the lyrics stopped me in my tracks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>Incommunicado&lt;/em> is about ambition, the drive to make it big without taking responsibilities. In the context of the entire album, it&amp;#39;s both a metaphor for the difficult life of Torch, the main character whose life is falling to pieces, but also a direct description of the music business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>Sugar Mice&lt;/em> is a song about the devastating effects of unemployment and economic recession. The title refers to a popular english sweet made of sugar. The main refrain &amp;#34;We&amp;#39;re just sugar mice in the rain&amp;#34; gives a very vivid representation of how fragile life can be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
The words, references, and metaphors included in the lyrics stood out as something completely out of the ordinary - it &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">sounded&lt;/span> like poetry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
The more I explored other Marillion&amp;#39;s songs, the more I realized that what really resonated with me was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_(singer)">Fish&lt;/a>, their initial singer and lyricist. Following his body of work after he left Marillion, I kept finding incredible songs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-3">
&lt;h3 id="headline-3">
Love and relationships
&lt;/h3>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Do you remember?&lt;br>
Barefoot on the lawn with shooting stars&lt;br>
Do you remember?&lt;br>
The loving on the floor in Belsize Park&lt;br>
Do you remember?&lt;br>
Dancing in stilettoes in the snow&lt;br>
Do you remember?&lt;br>
You never understood I had to go&lt;br>
By the way, didn&amp;#39;t I break your heart?&lt;br>
Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart&lt;br>
So sorry, I never meant to break your heart&lt;br>
But you broke mine — &lt;em>Kayleigh, 1985&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
By far the most succesful Marillion song, &lt;em>Kayleigh&lt;/em> is often cited as Fish&amp;#39;s apology to different women for the failure of their romantic relationships, a collage of vivid images and melancholic moments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4oaLUilBc" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
To me, this song sows the seeds of a theme that goes through a few songs written by Fish: work/life balance. Relationships fail when you divert your attention away from them, when you don&amp;#39;t put in everyday work to keep them going.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
In &lt;em>Zoë 25&lt;/em> it&amp;#39;s the aftermath of another relationship that didn&amp;#39;t go well:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When you&amp;#39;re looking for somebody, you might not even see them, &lt;br>
When they&amp;#39;re standing there in front of you, right before your eyes, &lt;br>
If you&amp;#39;re looking for somebody you&amp;#39;re gonna need some help, &lt;br>
You know you&amp;#39;ll never find her when you&amp;#39;re looking for yourself. — &lt;em>Zoë 25, 2007&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
In &lt;em>Garden of Remembrance&lt;/em>, it&amp;#39;s Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease, something completely outside our control:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>He&amp;#39;s lost between the here and now&lt;br>
Somewhere that he can&amp;#39;t be found&lt;br>
She&amp;#39;s still here&lt;br>
Her love a ghost of memory&lt;br>
She&amp;#39;ll wait for an eternity&lt;br>
He&amp;#39;s still here — &lt;em>Garden of Remembrance, 2020&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
In &lt;em>cliche&lt;/em>, the song lyrics use estabilished cliches to acknowledge that no matter how much hard you try, sometimes the simplest thing you can say is what matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m trying to say with my deepest sincerity&lt;br>
That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m finding it comes down to the basic simplicities&lt;br>
The best way is with an old cliche&lt;br>
It&amp;#39;s simply the best way is with an old cliche&lt;br>
Always the best way is with an old cliche&lt;br>
I&amp;#39;ll leave it to the best way, it&amp;#39;s an old cliche&lt;br>
I love you. — &lt;em>Cliche, 1990&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
In &lt;em>Punch and Judy&lt;/em>&lt;sup class="footnote-reference">&lt;a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> it&amp;#39;s the progressive deterioration of a relationship, escalating in murdering fantasies:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Whatever happened to morning smiles,&lt;br>
Whatever happened to wicked wiles, permissive styles,&lt;br>
Whatever happened to twinkling eyes,&lt;br>
Whatever happened to hard fast drives,&lt;br>
Complements on unnatural size&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Punch, Punch, Punch And Judy, Punch, Punch, Punch And Judy&lt;br>
Punch, Punch, Punch And Judy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Propping up a bar, family car,&lt;br>
Sweating out a mortgage as a balding clerk,&lt;br>
Punch And Judy, [Judy]&lt;br>
World war three, suburbanshee,&lt;br>
Just slip her these pills and I&amp;#39;ll be free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
No more Judy, Judy. Judy no more! Goodbye Judy! — &lt;em>Punch and Judy, 1984&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-3">
&lt;h3 id="headline-4">
Living on your own terms
&lt;/h3>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
&lt;p>
Another recurring topic is the idea of living on your own terms. From &lt;em>Tongues&lt;/em>, where Fish lets out the frustration of dealing with lawyers during a very long lawsuit with music publisher EMI:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Your entrenched opinions,&lt;br>
On the border of arrogance,&lt;br>
Dug in against the compromise.&lt;br>
A position indefensible, your actions illogical&lt;br>
You&amp;#39;re speaking in tongues&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
You swear contradictions&lt;br>
Your tedious monologues, wielding authority,&lt;br>
Demanding subservience, demanding&lt;br>
I make your sense.&lt;br>
Demanding speaking in tongues. — &lt;em>Tongues, 1991&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
The inability to speak the same language becomes a massive blocker. The aforementioned lawsuit with EMI ended up being a fundamental event in Fish&amp;#39;s life, pushing him to pursue the ownership of all rights of his solo albums (except the first one, &lt;em>Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors&lt;/em>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
In &lt;em>Circle Line&lt;/em>&lt;sup class="footnote-reference">&lt;a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, it&amp;#39;s the awareness of the 9-to-5 grind that is imposed on the majority of us:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>9 to 5&amp;#39;s the only time I try to kid myself that I&amp;#39;m still alive,&lt;br>
That I&amp;#39;m living out the dream to earn my freedom from this rat race&lt;br>
Where all I do&amp;#39;s survive, I live the lie, I serve my time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
The circle line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Just another day, just another day, just another day,&lt;br>
Just another day, just another day, just another day on the circle line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
The circle line, on the circle line. — &lt;em>Circle Line, 2007&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>Lost Plot&lt;/em>, on losing track of what matters:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I was blinded by light but the vision had died, I&amp;#39;d forgotten&lt;br>
In time just what I was fighting for&lt;br>
I&amp;#39;d forgotten who&amp;#39;s side I was on, the difference between&lt;br>
Right and wrong&lt;br>
I was out of my depth, going out of my mind, going down in&lt;br>
A field where no prisoners are taken, no quarter is given&lt;br>
The writing was small, it burned on the wall, I&amp;#39;d sold out&lt;br>
My soul for what it was worth&lt;br>
I&amp;#39;d lost the plot, my number was up, the game was over&lt;br>
Snakes and ladders, a world of snakes and ladders, snakes&lt;br>
And ladders — &lt;em>Lost Plot, 2004&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>View from the Hill&lt;/em>, where we the hill is an endless collection of things that don&amp;#39;t matter and just keep us imprisoned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You sit and think that everything is coming up roses&lt;br>
But you can&amp;#39;t see the weeds that entangle your feet&lt;br>
You can&amp;#39;t see the wood for the trees &amp;#39;cause the forest is burning&lt;br>
And you say it&amp;#39;s the smoke in your eyes that&amp;#39;s making you cry&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
They sold you the view from a hill&lt;br>
They told you that the view from the hill would be&lt;br>
Further than you have ever seen before&lt;br>
They sold you a view from a hill&lt;br>
They sold you a view from a hill — &lt;em>View from the Hill, 1990&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-3">
&lt;h3 id="headline-5">
The system has failed (us)
&lt;/h3>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
&lt;p>
Fish has never shied away from commenting on politics: from &lt;em>Market Square Heroes&lt;/em> (Marillion&amp;#39;s first single) to &lt;em>Weltschmerz&lt;/em>, the ending track of his latest (and last) album.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>Market Square Heroes&lt;/em>&lt;sup class="footnote-reference">&lt;a id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> is once again an anthem of an angry generation that suffers the consequences of austerity and recession:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I give peace signs when I wage war in the disco&lt;br>
I&amp;#39;m the warrior in the ultra violet haze&lt;br>
Armed with antisocial insecurity&lt;br>
I plan the path of destiny from this maze&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Cause I&amp;#39;m a Market Square hero gathering the storms to troop&lt;br>
Cause I&amp;#39;m a Market Square hero speeding the beat of the street pulse&lt;br>
Are you following me, are you following me?&lt;br>
Well suffer my fallen angels and follow me&lt;br>
I&amp;#39;m the Market Square hero, I&amp;#39;m the Market Square hero&lt;br>
We are Market Square Heroes, to be Market Square Heroes — &lt;em>Market Square Heroes, 1982&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>Weltschmerz&lt;/em> is a summary of all fights worth fighting - from climate change, to poverty, to the general failure of a political system that emphasized polarisation and division:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I am a grey bearded warrior, a poet of no mean acclaim&lt;br>
My words are my weapons that I proffer with disdain&lt;br>
My melancholy aspect is something you can’t disregard&lt;br>
My motives you cannot question nor my strong sense of right and wrong\\&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
I’ve formed the opinion that things can’t stay as they are&lt;br>
My anger and my fury trapped like a wasp in a jar&lt;br>
It’s never too late to make a brave new start&lt;br>
When the revolution is called I will play my part — &lt;em>Weltschmerz, 2020&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>

&lt;h3 id="headline-6">
Perfume River
&lt;/h3>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
&lt;p>
&lt;em>Perfume River&lt;/em>&lt;sup class="footnote-reference">&lt;a id="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> deserves a mention on its own: in this song, Fish looks at the consequences of the Vietnam War, whose images are burned in his childhood memory.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Fire breathing dragons swarm in sweltering skies, spewing flame on innocents below&lt;br>
Charred and brittle corpses, blackened evidence, I am enraged, I am afraid, I am forlorn&lt;br>
The ashes from wise pages fly from libraries, tumble in the clouds of smoke and flies&lt;br>
To lie as dust in corners of dark palaces, the fetid smell of revolution haunts the air.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Take me away to the Perfume River; carry me down to the perfume river&lt;br>
Set me adrift on a well-stocked open boat&lt;br>
Show me the way to the Perfume River, send me away down the perfume river&lt;br>
Pour that sweet, sweet liquor down my throat; pour it down my throat — &lt;em>Perfume River, 2013&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
Once again, the images evoked are incredibly strong, full of colour - red flames and rage, smoke, dust and death.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>

A powerful ingredient in Fish&amp;#39;s artistic work has always been his collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.the-masque.com/mainpage.html">Mark Wilkinson&lt;/a>, who illustrated all Marillion&amp;#39;s albums (until Fish left the band) and all of Fish&amp;#39;s work. His surrealistic style is unmistakable and perfectly complements the &amp;#34;visual&amp;#34; nature of a lot of Fish&amp;#39;s songs.&lt;/p>
