Since I was a toddler, my parents (and particularly my dad) got me used to listen to 80s rock music. Bands like Queen, Guns N&amp;#39; Roses, AC/DC, Van Halen, and Bon Jovi are ingrained in my memories as sounds of my childhood.
It&amp;#39;s not surprising that my taste in music has developed from there, branching out over the years in metal and progressive rock.</description></item></channel></rss>
