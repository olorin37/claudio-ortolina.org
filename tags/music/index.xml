&lt;p>
&lt;a href="http://publicservicebroadcasting.net/">Public Service Broadcasting&lt;/a> (PBS for short) are a trio based in London, whose music usually involves historical audio documents with a mix of jazz, rock and electronic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Each one of their album revolves around a specific theme, usually inspired by modern/contemporary history, and includes a vast amount of archival audio footage, recording, and samples, with very little vocals on top.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
In 2015 they released &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Race_for_Space_(album)">The Race for Space&lt;/a>, a concept album that explores the first 15 years of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race">Space Race&lt;/a> missions, from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1">Sputnik 1&lt;/a>&amp;#39;s flight in 1957 to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_17">last Apollo mission&lt;/a> in 1972.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
The general tone celebrates achievements of both US and Soviet Union, emphasising each step as a human endeavour that transcends borders and politics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Between music, vocals and engineering, the album involved another 35 people, which is something you can only perceive after listening to it a few times: some of the instruments are particularly subtle and deserve special attention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Each song has a different personality and it&amp;#39;s difficult to attribute a general genre to the entire album, but I can feel a general underlying cohesion which makes it that I rarely listen to one song and prefer to just play the entire record.&lt;/p>
&lt;div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-2">

1. The Race for Space

&lt;/div>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
The album opens with rearranged fragments of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_choose_to_go_to_the_Moon">US President John F. Kennedy&amp;#39;s speech&lt;/a> given at Rice University, Houston, Texas, on September 12, 1962. The speech sets the tone of the entire album, celebrating mankind&amp;#39;s efforts to reach beyond the stars:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Many years ago, Great British explorer George Mallory &lt;br>
Who was to die on Mount Everest &lt;br>
Was asked &amp;#39;why did he want to climb it?&amp;#39; &lt;br>
He said &amp;#39;because it is there&amp;#39; &lt;br>
Well space is there and we&amp;#39;re going to climb it &lt;br>
And the moon and the planets are there &lt;br>
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there &lt;br>
And therefore as we set sail we ask God&amp;#39;s blessing &lt;br>
On the most hazardous, and dangerous, and greatest adventure &lt;br>
On which man has ever embarked – John F. Kennedy&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
It&amp;#39;s difficult to listen to this speech without anticipation, especially knowing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11">what would happen 7 years later&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="outline-container-headline-2" class="outline-2">
&lt;h2 id="headline-2">
2. Sputnik
&lt;/h2>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
&lt;p>
The second track, &lt;em>Sputnik&lt;/em>, takes us to the Soviet Union in 1957, to tell the story of the first object ever sent into space, the low Earth orbit satellite &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1">Sputnik 1&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
In &lt;em>Sputnik&lt;/em>, the original sounds of the unmanned spacecraft gradually become part of the main beat and gradually build excitement for the beginning of &amp;#34;man&amp;#39;s cosmic existence&amp;#34;.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The man made celestial body, for the first time in history &lt;br>
Overcame terrestrial gravity and flew into space &lt;br>
All men of all nations recognise this as a great achievement &lt;br>
In an age where the race to conquer space has become an all-absorbing factor&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
The era of man&amp;#39;s cosmic existence&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
Once again, the accent is on how people can be united by such an important event:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>All over the world, people are tuning in to the &amp;#39;bleep bleep bleep&amp;#39; of the satellite&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
A dream cherished by men for many centuries comes true on October the 4th, 1957&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-2">
&lt;h2 id="headline-3">
3. Gagarin
&lt;/h2>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
&lt;p>
If &lt;em>Sputnik&lt;/em> makes you tap your feet, then &lt;em>Gagarin&lt;/em> will make you dance: to tell the story of the first ever cosmonaut, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin&lt;/a>, PBS wrote an explosive song, a mix of funk, brass, marching band, you-name-it tune that captures the euphoria of such an important moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wY-kAnvOY80" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
The jump into the unknown is not something to be scared of:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The World&amp;#39;s first cosmonaut &lt;br>
The first to open the door into the unknown &lt;br>
The first to step over the threshold of our homeland&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
Gagarin himself appreciated his new vantage point:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Astronaut to Earth: I can see forests, rivers, [?] all around &lt;br>
Everything&amp;#39;s so beautiful, it&amp;#39;s wonderful, it wonderful…&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;h2 id="headline-4">
4. Fire in the Cockpit
&lt;/h2>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
&lt;p>
After &lt;em>Gagarin&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Fire in the Cockpit&lt;/em> is a cold shower and a stark reminder of the risks and cost of exploration, telling the tragedy of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1">Apollo 1&lt;/a>, where three astronauts lost their lives due to a cabin fire during a test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
The entire song revolves around the sound of static and deep keyboard tones, with a cello entering midway as we listen to the words of NASA&amp;#39;s description of the events. It&amp;#39;s a sad song, but exhibits the composure and respect owed to people who lost their lives while trying to advance the frontiers of human knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-2">

5. E.V.A.
&lt;/h2>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
&lt;p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
In &lt;em>E.V.A.&lt;/em>&lt;sup class="footnote-reference">&lt;a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> we hear the story of Alexei Leonov, Alexei Leonov completed the first spacewalk in 1965, spending 10 minutes outside in open space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
It&amp;#39;s interesting how the music almost stops when the astronaut leaves the spacecraft, mimicking the silence of the vacuum of space. The few piano notes we can hear really complement the marvel of Leonov&amp;#39;s words:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;#39;m on the edge of the opening &lt;br>
Of the airlock chamber &lt;br>
I feel excellent &lt;br>
I see clouds and the sea &lt;br>
I am beginning to move away&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>

&lt;h2 id="headline-6">
6. The Other Side
&lt;/h2>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
&lt;p>
&lt;em>The Other Side&lt;/em> takes us one step closer to the moon landing, focusing on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8">Apollo 8&lt;/a> mission, where for the first time a manned spacecraft completed an orbit of the moon, but from the unusual point of view of ground control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
We hear voices and recordings from the control room, where ground control monitors the spacecraft as it&amp;#39;s about to reach the blind side of the moon. The excitement and anxiety are palpable: to complete a lunar orbit, Apollo will temporarily lose signal with earth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Once again, the music tells the story without words, getting quiet during loss of signal and exploding into a liberating instrumental when Apollo finally replies back to Houston. The event is incredibly significant:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The unmanned lunar spacecraft traversed the moon perhaps over 10, 000 times &lt;br>
But this is the first that a man aboard reported to his compatriots here on Earth&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-2">
&lt;h2 id="headline-7">
7. Valentina
&lt;/h2>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
&lt;p>
&lt;em>Valentina&lt;/em> is a celebration of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentina_Tereshkova">Valentina Tereshkova&lt;/a>, the first woman to ever go to space n 1963 (and to this date, the only one having ever been in a solo mission).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
The song, which features choruses from &lt;a href="http://www.smokefairies.com/">The Smoke Fairies&lt;/a>, is a graceful instrumental without any other vocals. J. Willgoose, Esq. writes on the matter:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>One of the biggest problems with the material we use, from the period we address, is that it almost totally devoid of any female voice. &lt;br>
It is often said that history is written by the winners, but it would be equally if not more apt to say that it has overwhelmingly been written by men. Of the footage I obtained of the first woman in space, all of it featured her voice being translated by male voices. &lt;br>
Rather than yet more men - us, in this case - attempting to speak on her behalf, it seemed more appropriate to ask a guest singer to provide a female voice, so we tried a different approach with &amp;#39;Valentina&amp;#39; and I&amp;#39;m very glad we did.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="outline-container-headline-8" class="outline-2">
&lt;h2 id="headline-8">
8. Go!
&lt;/h2>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
&lt;p>
The story of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11">Apollo 11&lt;/a> and the first crew to land on the moon in 1969 represents one of the most important moments of human history. Once again, PBS decides to focus on the point of view of the people on the ground, to celebrate the often unseen work of preparation, monitoring, incredible engineering that made the whole thing possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BHIo6qwJarI" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>Go!&lt;/em> is giant checklist, where we hear the flight director Gene Kranz go through all the checks needed to make sure that the descent on the moon will be successful. It&amp;#39;s so interesting that the landing itself is just a couple of verses in the middle:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Houston, uh &lt;br>
Tranquility base here, The Eagle has landed&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
The repetition in the dialogues provides the rhythm of the song, which matches the excitement of the mission with upbeat percussions, synth and keyboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>Go!&lt;/em> is a reminder that we can achieve the impossible if we work together.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="outline-container-headline-9" class="outline-2">
&lt;h2 id="headline-9">
9. Tomorrow
&lt;/h2>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-2">
&lt;p>
The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_17">Apollo 17&lt;/a> mission, the last in the Apollo program, represents the end of an era and the last time we landed on the moon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>Tomorrow&lt;/em> reflects on its significance: as a species, we managed to leave our own planet, albeit temporarily, and look beyond to a completely unexplored universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
While it&amp;#39;s not possible to separate the space race from the politics that fueled it in the first place, it&amp;#39;s also a testament to the effort of thousands of people over decades, to literally take us where no one has ever been before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
As an outro, &lt;em>Tomorrow&lt;/em> tempers the excitement of the previous songs and focuses more on choruses and keyboard, painting a picture of anticipation of what&amp;#39;s gonna come next.&lt;/p>

&lt;div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-3">
&lt;h3 id="headline-1">
Prelude
&lt;/h3>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-3">
&lt;p>
I have very early memories of rock music in my life. Since I was a toddler, my parents (and particularly my dad) got me used to listen to 80s rock music. Bands like Queen, Guns N&amp;#39; Roses, AC/DC, Van Halen, and Bon Jovi are ingrained in my memories as sounds of my childhood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
It&amp;#39;s not surprising that my taste in music has developed from there, branching out over the years in metal and progressive rock. Music is a constant companion of my daily life and contributed to the formation of my identity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
My taste changed and adapted: around ten years ago I was dismissing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation:_Mindcrime">&lt;em>Operation: Mindcrime&lt;/em>&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensrÿche">Queensrÿche&lt;/a> as a mediocre album, but two years ago I picked it up again and it was a revelation. Something similar happened while listening to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_Against_the_Machine">Rage Against the Machine&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool">Tool&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Perfect_Circle">A Perfect Circle&lt;/a>, didn&amp;#39;t like them years ago, absolutely love them now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
This change got me thinking - why do these bands resonate with me now?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
I think the answer lies primarily in the integrity of the message connected to these bands: their perspective, political stance, perspective on life really struck a cord with me in my 30s. They take an explicit position around issues I care about.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="outline-container-headline-2" class="outline-3">
&lt;h3 id="headline-2">
Enter Marillion and Fish
&lt;/h3>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
&lt;p>
&lt;img src="http://claudio-ortolina.org/img/fish/fish-photo.jpg" alt="Fish&amp;#39;s portrait" class="left" style="float: left; margin-right: 1rem;" />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Until a year ago, I had a very cursory knowledge of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marillion">Marillion&lt;/a>&amp;#39;s body of work. I kney they existed, that they have a substantial discography and that they represent an important page in the history of 80s and 90s prog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
One morning, Spotify&amp;#39;s suggestions algorithm decided to play &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lalBmbrWEvQ">&lt;em>Incommunicado&lt;/em>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6COmtBk6lYo">&lt;em>Sugar Mice&lt;/em>&lt;/a> in the space of an hour. I found myself stopping what I was doing in both instances - there was something about those songs that really dragged my attention. I loved the music - but the lyrics stopped me in my tracks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>Incommunicado&lt;/em> is about ambition, the drive to make it big without taking responsibilities. In the context of the entire album, it&amp;#39;s both a metaphor for the difficult life of Torch, the main character whose life is falling to pieces, but also a direct description of the music business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>Sugar Mice&lt;/em> is a song about the devastating effects of unemployment and economic recession. The title refers to a popular english sweet made of sugar. The main refrain &amp;#34;We&amp;#39;re just sugar mice in the rain&amp;#34; gives a very vivid representation of how fragile life can be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
The words, references, and metaphors included in the lyrics stood out as something completely out of the ordinary - it &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">sounded&lt;/span> like poetry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
The more I explored other Marillion&amp;#39;s songs, the more I realized that what really resonated with me was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_(singer)">Fish&lt;/a>, their initial singer and lyricist. Following his body of work after he left Marillion, I kept finding incredible songs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-3">
&lt;h3 id="headline-3">
Love and relationships
&lt;/h3>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Do you remember?&lt;br>
Barefoot on the lawn with shooting stars&lt;br>
Do you remember?&lt;br>
The loving on the floor in Belsize Park&lt;br>
Do you remember?&lt;br>
Dancing in stilettoes in the snow&lt;br>
Do you remember?&lt;br>
You never understood I had to go&lt;br>
By the way, didn&amp;#39;t I break your heart?&lt;br>
Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart&lt;br>
So sorry, I never meant to break your heart&lt;br>
But you broke mine — &lt;em>Kayleigh, 1985&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
By far the most succesful Marillion song, &lt;em>Kayleigh&lt;/em> is often cited as Fish&amp;#39;s apology to different women for the failure of their romantic relationships, a collage of vivid images and melancholic moments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
To me, this song sows the seeds of a theme that goes through a few songs written by Fish: work/life balance. Relationships fail when you divert your attention away from them, when you don&amp;#39;t put in everyday work to keep them going.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
In &lt;em>Zoë 25&lt;/em> it&amp;#39;s the aftermath of another relationship that didn&amp;#39;t go well:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When you&amp;#39;re looking for somebody, you might not even see them, &lt;br>
When they&amp;#39;re standing there in front of you, right before your eyes, &lt;br>
If you&amp;#39;re looking for somebody you&amp;#39;re gonna need some help, &lt;br>
You know you&amp;#39;ll never find her when you&amp;#39;re looking for yourself. — &lt;em>Zoë 25, 2007&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
In &lt;em>Garden of Remembrance&lt;/em>, it&amp;#39;s Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease, something completely outside our control:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>He&amp;#39;s lost between the here and now&lt;br>
Somewhere that he can&amp;#39;t be found&lt;br>
She&amp;#39;s still here&lt;br>
Her love a ghost of memory&lt;br>
She&amp;#39;ll wait for an eternity&lt;br>
He&amp;#39;s still here — &lt;em>Garden of Remembrance, 2020&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>
In &lt;em>cliche&lt;/em>, the song lyrics use estabilished cliches to acknowledge that no matter how much hard you try, sometimes the simplest thing you can say is what matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m trying to say with my deepest sincerity&lt;br>
That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m finding it comes down to the basic simplicities&lt;br>
The best way is with an old cliche&lt;br>
It&amp;#39;s simply the best way is with an old cliche&lt;br>
Always the best way is with an old cliche&lt;br>
I&amp;#39;ll leave it to the best way, it&amp;#39;s an old cliche&lt;br>
I love you. — &lt;em>Cliche, 1990&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

In &lt;em>Punch and Judy&lt;/em>&lt;sup class="footnote-reference">&lt;a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> it&amp;#39;s the progressive deterioration of a relationship, escalating in murdering fantasies:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Whatever happened to morning smiles,&lt;br>
Whatever happened to wicked wiles, permissive styles,&lt;br>
Whatever happened to twinkling eyes,&lt;br>
Whatever happened to hard fast drives,&lt;br>
Complements on unnatural size&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Punch, Punch, Punch And Judy, Punch, Punch, Punch And Judy&lt;br>
Punch, Punch, Punch And Judy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Propping up a bar, family car,&lt;br>
Sweating out a mortgage as a balding clerk,&lt;br>
Punch And Judy, [Judy]&lt;br>
World war three, suburbanshee,&lt;br>
Just slip her these pills and I&amp;#39;ll be free.&lt;/p>

No more Judy, Judy. Judy no more! Goodbye Judy! — &lt;em>Punch and Judy, 1984&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

Living on your own terms
&lt;/h3>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
&lt;p>
Another recurring topic is the idea of living on your own terms. From &lt;em>Tongues&lt;/em>, where Fish lets out the frustration of dealing with lawyers during a very long lawsuit with music publisher EMI:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Your entrenched opinions,&lt;br>
On the border of arrogance,&lt;br>
Dug in against the compromise.&lt;br>
A position indefensible, your actions illogical&lt;br>
You&amp;#39;re speaking in tongues&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
You swear contradictions&lt;br>
Your tedious monologues, wielding authority,&lt;br>
Demanding subservience, demanding&lt;br>
I make your sense.&lt;br>
Demanding speaking in tongues. — &lt;em>Tongues, 1991&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
The inability to speak the same language becomes a massive blocker. The aforementioned lawsuit with EMI ended up being a fundamental event in Fish&amp;#39;s life, pushing him to pursue the ownership of all rights of his solo albums (except the first one, &lt;em>Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors&lt;/em>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
In &lt;em>Circle Line&lt;/em>&lt;sup class="footnote-reference">&lt;a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, it&amp;#39;s the awareness of the 9-to-5 grind that is imposed on the majority of us:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>9 to 5&amp;#39;s the only time I try to kid myself that I&amp;#39;m still alive,&lt;br>
That I&amp;#39;m living out the dream to earn my freedom from this rat race&lt;br>
Where all I do&amp;#39;s survive, I live the lie, I serve my time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
The circle line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Just another day, just another day, just another day,&lt;br>
Just another day, just another day, just another day on the circle line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
The circle line, on the circle line. — &lt;em>Circle Line, 2007&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>Lost Plot&lt;/em>, on losing track of what matters:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I was blinded by light but the vision had died, I&amp;#39;d forgotten&lt;br>
In time just what I was fighting for&lt;br>
I&amp;#39;d forgotten who&amp;#39;s side I was on, the difference between&lt;br>
Right and wrong&lt;br>
I was out of my depth, going out of my mind, going down in&lt;br>
A field where no prisoners are taken, no quarter is given&lt;br>
The writing was small, it burned on the wall, I&amp;#39;d sold out&lt;br>
My soul for what it was worth&lt;br>
I&amp;#39;d lost the plot, my number was up, the game was over&lt;br>
Snakes and ladders, a world of snakes and ladders, snakes&lt;br>
And ladders — &lt;em>Lost Plot, 2004&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>View from the Hill&lt;/em>, where we the hill is an endless collection of things that don&amp;#39;t matter and just keep us imprisoned.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You sit and think that everything is coming up roses&lt;br>
But you can&amp;#39;t see the weeds that entangle your feet&lt;br>
You can&amp;#39;t see the wood for the trees &amp;#39;cause the forest is burning&lt;br>
And you say it&amp;#39;s the smoke in your eyes that&amp;#39;s making you cry&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
They sold you the view from a hill&lt;br>
They told you that the view from the hill would be&lt;br>
Further than you have ever seen before&lt;br>
They sold you a view from a hill&lt;br>
They sold you a view from a hill — &lt;em>View from the Hill, 1990&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

Fish has never shied away from commenting on politics: from &lt;em>Market Square Heroes&lt;/em> (Marillion&amp;#39;s first single) to &lt;em>Weltschmerz&lt;/em>, the ending track of his latest (and last) album.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>Market Square Heroes&lt;/em>&lt;sup class="footnote-reference">&lt;a id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> is once again an anthem of an angry generation that suffers the consequences of austerity and recession:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I give peace signs when I wage war in the disco&lt;br>
I&amp;#39;m the warrior in the ultra violet haze&lt;br>
Armed with antisocial insecurity&lt;br>
I plan the path of destiny from this maze&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Cause I&amp;#39;m a Market Square hero gathering the storms to troop&lt;br>
Cause I&amp;#39;m a Market Square hero speeding the beat of the street pulse&lt;br>
Are you following me, are you following me?&lt;br>
Well suffer my fallen angels and follow me&lt;br>
I&amp;#39;m the Market Square hero, I&amp;#39;m the Market Square hero&lt;br>
We are Market Square Heroes, to be Market Square Heroes — &lt;em>Market Square Heroes, 1982&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
&lt;em>Weltschmerz&lt;/em> is a summary of all fights worth fighting - from climate change, to poverty, to the general failure of a political system that emphasized polarisation and division:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I am a grey bearded warrior, a poet of no mean acclaim&lt;br>
My words are my weapons that I proffer with disdain&lt;br>
My melancholy aspect is something you can’t disregard&lt;br>
My motives you cannot question nor my strong sense of right and wrong\\&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
I’ve formed the opinion that things can’t stay as they are&lt;br>
My anger and my fury trapped like a wasp in a jar&lt;br>
It’s never too late to make a brave new start&lt;br>
When the revolution is called I will play my part — &lt;em>Weltschmerz, 2020&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>
&lt;em>Perfume River&lt;/em>&lt;sup class="footnote-reference">&lt;a id="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> deserves a mention on its own: in this song, Fish looks at the consequences of the Vietnam War, whose images are burned in his childhood memory.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Fire breathing dragons swarm in sweltering skies, spewing flame on innocents below&lt;br>
Charred and brittle corpses, blackened evidence, I am enraged, I am afraid, I am forlorn&lt;br>
The ashes from wise pages fly from libraries, tumble in the clouds of smoke and flies&lt;br>
To lie as dust in corners of dark palaces, the fetid smell of revolution haunts the air.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Take me away to the Perfume River; carry me down to the perfume river&lt;br>
Set me adrift on a well-stocked open boat&lt;br>
Show me the way to the Perfume River, send me away down the perfume river&lt;br>
Pour that sweet, sweet liquor down my throat; pour it down my throat — &lt;em>Perfume River, 2013&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
Once again, the images evoked are incredibly strong, full of colour - red flames and rage, smoke, dust and death.&lt;/p>

A powerful ingredient in Fish&amp;#39;s artistic work has always been his collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.the-masque.com/mainpage.html">Mark Wilkinson&lt;/a>, who illustrated all Marillion&amp;#39;s albums (until Fish left the band) and all of Fish&amp;#39;s work. His surrealistic style is unmistakable and perfectly complements the &amp;#34;visual&amp;#34; nature of a lot of Fish&amp;#39;s songs.&lt;/p>
